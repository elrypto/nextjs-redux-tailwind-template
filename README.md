## nextjs-redux-tailwind-template

### nextjs 9.3+ project configured for
redux (via redux toolkit) and tailwind (with purge-css). Support for typescript with react testing library. Verbose configuration for eslint and prettier. Includes commonly used fontawesome react libraries and some other (arguably) useful common components.

### to run
suggested you use 

`yarn cdev` or `npm run cdev`

which launches next in dev mode with concurrently which at the same time launches tsc (which also does type checking)
