### nextjs 9.3+ project configured for
redux (via redux toolkit) and tailwind (with purge-css) and support typescript with react testing library, and also verbose configuration for eslint and prettier. Also commonly used fontawesome react libraries and some other arguably useful common components.

`yarn cdev` or `npm run cdev`

which launches next in dev mode with concurrently which at the same time launches tsc (which also does type checking)
